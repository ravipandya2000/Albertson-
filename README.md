🛒 Albertsons FMCG Profitability Dashboard 📊
Excited to share my latest project using Power BI to visualize and model advanced Retail Profitability for Albertsons' Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) division!

Excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard project analyzing Holiday Sales performance. This dashboard highlights critical State-Level Profitability, the true impact of Discounting Strategies, and Geospatial Sales Anomalies that will help the business drive smarter, margin-focused category decisions. 📈

🚀 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 :

Geospatial Visualization: Creating interactive map reports to display key metrics (Sales, Profit, Discount) across US States, driving targeted regional strategy.

Advanced Profit Modeling: Using built-in tools and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate true Profit Margin (Profit/Sales) and benchmark the financial health of holiday promotions.

Time-Based Filtering: Integrating the Holiday Flag and transaction data for precise analysis of sales performance during peak, high-stakes periods.

Business Intelligence: Providing actionable insights to pinpoint loss-making promotions and scale high-margin opportunities for optimal category management.

Overall, this project enhances margin control and strategic planning by providing powerful tools for geospatial and profitability analysis.

✅ Dashboard Insights:

Profitability breakdown by State, Category, and Discount Level.

Identification of loss-making discount promotions in key categories (e.g., Meat & Seafood, Dairy).

Geographic mapping of high-margin sales achieved with discount.

Concentration of holiday sales volume by State (e.g., California).

🎯 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻

This dashboard showcases how complex, multi-dimensional retail data (Profit × Sales × State × Discount × Holiday) can be transformed into actionable intelligence using Power BI—empowering Albertsons to optimize pricing and maximize profit margins.# Albertson-
